        <h4>Noah's Runch</h4>
        <p>This is the first recipe I made on my own! I love to cook and experiment.
            I made this to go with my brother's fried rice. It's the perfect combination of sour and rancid!

        <p>No chef's arsenal is complete without this all purpose ingredient</p>

        <h3 class="greds">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="readable">
            <li>1 gallon Milk</li>
            <li>1 cup whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 can of MtnDew pitch black</li>
            <li id="scream">crust</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl or stand mixer combine the gallon of milk and can of MtnDew pitch black</li>
            <li>Whip this mixture until it is homogenous and fluffy</li>
            <li>Slowly fold in the whole black peppercorns to taste</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in some crust on the top and it's finished!</li>
            <p>I recommend bottling this and keep it refridgeerated. It should last a year in the fridge!</p>
